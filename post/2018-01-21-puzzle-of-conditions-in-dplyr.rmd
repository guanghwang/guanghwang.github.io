# Puzzle
I am not sure how do I condition on whether a value in column A appears in column B?

I use the naive way 
```
value A %in% column B
```
within a mutate function. It workers such that R would search all values in column B. What's more, it even works within groups. However, I not sure whether it is a luck or a right way to do it?

# Example
```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = F)
```

**Data**
```{r}
df <- data.frame(a = c(1,2,3,4,5), b = c(3,2,4,5,6), group = c("a","a", "b", "b", "c"))
print(df)
```

**without group**
```{r}
df %>% mutate(c = as.integer(a %in% b), d = as.integer(a == b))
```

** by groups**
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  mutate(c = as.integer(a %in% b), d = as.integer(a == b))
```
