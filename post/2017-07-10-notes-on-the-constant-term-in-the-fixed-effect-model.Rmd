In stata, the fixed effect model(`xtreg y x1 x2 x3, fe`) report a constant term. The underline estimate is
$$y_{it} - \bar{yr} + \bar{\bar{y}} = a + (x_{it} - \bar{x_{i}} + \bar\bar{{x}})) \alpha + (\epsilon_it - \bar{e_i} + \bar{v)$$ with the constrant $\bar{v}$ equals to 0. Details can be found on [Stata's website](http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/intercept-in-fixed-effects-model/).

In R, `plm` package does not calculate the `some whate artificial`[^1] intercept for within models.
